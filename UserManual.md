# Introduction #

In this user manual we will demonstrate the features of Model2Roo, by developing several Java web systems based on the classical [PetClinic](http://static.springsource.org/docs/petclinic.html) application, which is a web system intended for clinic employees, who need to view and manage information regarding veterinarians, clients, and pets.

In particular, we demonstrate the data models currently supported by our tool (relational, document and graph), and also demonstrate how they can be used together as part of polyglot persistence applications.

  * RelationalModel
  * DocumentModel
  * GraphModel
  * PolyglotModel

As shown in the next figure, these sample projects can be imported into an Eclipse distribution by selecting the **File -> Import -> Existing projects into workspace** menu, and then selecting the examples directory contained in the Model2Roo [documentation bundle](https://model2roo.googlecode.com/files/Model2Roo_documentation.zip).
